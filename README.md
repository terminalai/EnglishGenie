# National AI Student Challenge

Okay so this is a thing that exists :disappointed:

Libraries of note (`AI-BRICKS`):
- [`sgnlp`](https://github.com/aisingapore/sgnlp/)
- [`seacorenlp`](https://pypi.org/project/seacorenlp/)


PeekingDuck also has some bindings that we might be able to use but for now, let's just deal with sgnlp.
